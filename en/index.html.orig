                        <p>We teach our classes in English, because computer languages are written in English. And most programmers in business are required to know English. Don’t worry if your English is limited. As long as you can read basic English you will be OK. The audio will have simultaneous closed captioning in English to make the English easier to understand.</p>

                        <h2>Girls wanted!</h2>
                        <p>Our school is named for Hypatia, because we believe more women need to work as computer programmers. Computer programming is something you can do over the internet. So you can work for companies in other European nations from right here in Cyprus. Women are in strong demand in IT, because there are so few of them. So it is easy for them to find jobs. We want to encourage girls to look beyond traditional areas where they might work and join with their male counterparts to work as engineers. Hypatia did that with mathematics. You can do that too.</p>

                        <h3>Women can program computers too.</h3>
                        <p>Something like 90% to 100% of computer programmers are male. That is just wrong. Women can do programming. In the United States some women work as engineers, but they are mainly immigrants from India.</p>
                        <p>Why do girls avoid working with computers? I don’t know. Maybe they think they are complicated? Nonsense. Computers are so easy even stupid boys can do it.</p>
                        <p>Maybe they think math is too hard? Wrong. Yes, you have to understand a little math to understand computers. For example, if you want to tell the computer to do something 10 times you have to be able to count to 10.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5">I was the worst math student when I was in secondary school. But I studied and earned a university degree in math. If someone as dumb as me can learn math then you can too.</p>

                            <p>We are not a school. Instead we offer afterschool education and classes during the summer.</p>
                            <p>In America, Korea, China, and other countries many children do this. My children went to school during the day and then went in the afternoons too for additional study. 100% of Chinese students in the USA do this too.</p>
                            <p>Cyprus public schools rank near the bottom in Europe when you look at the results of the PISA exam. And most schools here don’t teach computer programming. Do you want to learn something useful? Then learning computer programming with us.</p>
                            <p>Why is Google and Facebook in America and not Cyprus? That’s the wrong question. The correct question is, “When will a business like Google or Cyprus open in Cyprus?” Learn programming and help with that.</p>

                            <h3>Think about your future.</h3>
                            <p>Cyprus has an economy based on tourism, real estate, shipping, and forex. There are no more jobs in tourism and real estate and will not be for several years. Cyprus does not need anymore yoga instructors, life coaches, real estate agents, travel agents, or people selling items on Amazon.</p>
                            <p>What Cyprus needs are computer programmers. European and American companies especially are looking for female computer programmers. If you want to work for Amazon or Google they will hire you straight away just because you are a woman. This is because America believes there should be no discrimination. So they have to have women on staff.</p>
                            <h3 class="mt-5">Who Needs an Office? Computers and Remote Work are the Future</h3>
                            <p>Because of the coronavirus, the people who still have jobs today in Cyprus are people who can work from home. Everyone else has lost their job.</p>
                            <p>Computer programmers can work from anywhere, from the top of a tree to a deserted island. Cyprus is not a deserted island, but it’s an island. You can live in Cyprus and work for clients in the USA, Europe, Asia, and of course Cyprus.</p>
                            <p>It’s not just the coronavirus that has changed the world forever. Computers and especially computer machine learning have changed everything. Half of the professions that exist today will be gone in 10 years.</p>
                            <p>In my home country, the USA, we already have self driving cars and trucks. Computers are replacing doctors too, especially radiologists, as they are better at diagnosing disease than humans. Computers are replacing lawyers in America. All of this change will come to Cyprus</p>
                            <p class="mb-5">So if you want a future then you need to learn computer programming.</p>
